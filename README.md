## Problem Statement:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder primarily affecting individuals aged 60 and older globally. Approximately 15% of Parkinson's disease cases have a familial component attributed to genetic mutations in specific genes, while environmental factors such as exposure to toxins like farming chemicals and heavy metals like manganese can also contribute to Parkinson's-like symptoms. 
### It manifests through:
- Tremors in the hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head.
- Muscle stiffness.
- Slowness of movement.
- Improper mobility.
- Impaired balance and coordination.
- Loss of sense of smell.

Sudden muscle stiffness can lead to falls and accidents, significantly impacting daily life. In India, around 7 million older adults suffer from PD, with a projected global increase of 200-300% in the coming decades, according to experts1. Over the past 25 years, PD prevalence has doubled, with global estimates in 2019 surpassing 8.5 million cases. PD caused 5.8 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 329,000 deaths in 2019, marking an 81% and 100% increase since 2000 2, respectively. Addressing this growing burden requires concerted efforts in research, awareness, and access to effective treatments to mitigate its debilitating effects on individuals and societies.
